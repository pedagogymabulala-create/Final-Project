    <section class="Aboutme">
    <p>My name is Sibusiso Zwane, famously known as Pedagogy Mabulala, which basically means the master of pedagogy, and I am an aspiring educator deeply committed to transforming how young people experience learning. Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Education (B.Ed), I am continuously developing my knowledge of pedagogy, curriculum, and the diverse ways students make meaning of the world. I approach education not just as a profession, but as a purposeful space to inspire curiosity, confidence, and intellectual growth.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
    <p>I have a strong academic background in Computer Applications Technology (CAT), achieving an A in high school, and I carry this strength into my tutoring and teaching practice. My work often involves creating structured, accessible, and engaging learning materials such as notes, worksheets, quizzes, and instructional videos to help students make sense of complex topics in Mathematics and Physical Sciences. I have produced resources on and written a few powerful research papers about mathematics education in our country. I was a delegate in one of the international Mathematics conferences, to which I was invited by my Professor, Judah Makonye. During the conference, I presented a curriculum analysis on the topic of Financial Mathematics to scholars, lecturers from all over the world and different authors. In 2026, I will be focusing on physical science research since it will be my final year</p>

    <p>My teaching philosophy is grounded in three foundational values: access to epistemology, constructivism, and learner growth. I believe that every learner deserves access to powerful knowledge, and it is my responsibility to break down barriers that prevent them from engaging meaningfully with subject content. I view the classroom as a dynamic space where students build understanding actively through exploration, discussion, collaboration, and reflection rather than passively receiving information. Most importantly, I prioritise student growth, recognising that each learner brings unique experiences, abilities, and ways of thinking. My role is to guide, support, and challenge them in ways that nurture confidence, independence, and a genuine love for learning.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <p>As a tutor, I am also continually developing my communication, teamwork, and leadership skills. Working with learners from diverse backgrounds has strengthened my emotional intelligence and taught me to adapt to different personalities, moods, and learning styles. These experiences shape my belief that effective teaching requires empathy, patience, and an unwavering commitment to meeting students where they are. Whether I am explaining a challenging concept, designing a lesson, or mentoring a learner through their academic journey, I am guided by one goal: to make learning accessible, engaging, and transformative for every student I encounter.</p>
